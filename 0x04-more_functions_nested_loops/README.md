# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

Full Stack Software Engineering studies project at the ALX School. The aim of this project is to learn about nested loops in C language.

## Technologies
The technologies used for this project includes:
* gcc 4.8.4, for compiling C programs
* All C files are written according to the C90 standard
* All programs are tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
